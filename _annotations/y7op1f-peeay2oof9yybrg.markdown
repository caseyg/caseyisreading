h_content: 'June Callwood once asked her how she acquired “an exquisitely developed
  conscience.”Dr. Franklin replied: “You tune it like an instrument. You know, when
  people start singing they develop an ear. They develop their voice. They begin to
  hear dissonances that they didn’t hear before. You become attuned to having to make
  responsible and moral decisions. … [In Quakerism] you don’t have a creed, you don’t
  sign something; the only proof of your faith or lack of faith is how you conduct
  your life. Consequently it’s like singing. At every point you say, ‘Am I in tune?’”'
