h_exact: In both The International and Lombardi’s drawings, as well as in a show like
  The Wire to take another example, it is a double sense of failure – the failure
  of reform and the failure to transgress certain established epistemological limits
  – that emerges as a unifying theme.  What’s more – and this is also a point raised
  by Jameson in relation particularly to Parallax View – in both cases heroic, rogue
  individuals are set up against truly collective conspiracies, framing the impotence
  of the individual to affect real structural change or reform without making any
  attempt to posit a possible alternative, reformist – let alone revolutionary – subject.
