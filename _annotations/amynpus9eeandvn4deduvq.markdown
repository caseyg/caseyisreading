h_exact: In Barcelona "street reclaimers" invoked the slogan of the rebellious Paris
  students of 1968, "Sous les paves, la plage" ("Under the sidewalk, the beach") and,
  dressed in swimming costumes, put out towels and sun-bathed on the road, handed
  out French fries to commuters in their cars, and later took part in a 700-strong
  street party. Music and dancing also hit the streets of San Francisco with "art
  attackers" who, armed with giant puppets and candy, lobbied those working for multinationals
  that exploit sweatshop workers to take the day off work and "join the revolution."
  In Melbourne, Australia, Kim Beazley, leader of the opposition, received a custard
  pie in the face for speaking at a global trade conference sponsored by Shell, while
  thousands of party goers in Sydney held up traffic as a massive street festival
  got underway.
