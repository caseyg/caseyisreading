h_exact: 'In both oral and typographic cultures, information derives its importance
  from the possibilities of action. Of course, in any communication environment, input
  (what one is informed about) always exceeds output (the possibilities of action
  based on information). But the situation created by telegraphy, and then exacerbated
  by later technologies, made the relationship between information and action both
  abstract and remote. For the first time in human history, people were faced with
  the problem of information glut, which means that simultaneously they were faced
  with the problem of a diminished social and political potency. You may get a sense
  of what this means by asking yourself another series of questions: What steps do
  you plan to take to reduce the conflict in the Middle East? Or the rates of inflation,
  crime and unemployment? What are your plans for preserving the environment or reducing
  the risk of nuclear war? What do you plan to do about NATO, OPEC, the CIA, affirmative
  action, and the monstrous treatment of the Baha''is in Iran?'
