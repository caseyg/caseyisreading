h_exact: Pointing at something interesting is both vague and precise, and implies
  that there is more to see than can be seen, that we have recognized something portentous
  but at the same time are not sure what it is. The gesture is a promissory note,
  an assertion that this thing will reward further inspection. Does the mute and indicative
  nature of pointing itself reveal the nature of the interesting?
