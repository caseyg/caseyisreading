h_exact: And I’ve always thought that the only thing that I wanted, whether or not
  I could afford it, was to play with other people. So from 55 years ago to right

  important to everybody. I think that playing by yourself is really scary. If you
  don’t acknowledge what’s happening to you, if you give in to that poverty, and think

  defeated. Because you can’t make it by yourself, unless you set yourself on fire
  or something like that. There’s nothing you can do that’s interesting by yourself.
