h_exact: If by raising an ant farm I can get enough ants to make it viable to kill
  them for money, and I use this money to set up non-polluting sources of energy that
  can slowly make the polluting parts of energy production less attractive to the
  public so that eventually they get shut down, I will be able to shut down the ant
  farm once it's the last non-ethical manner of producing energy.
