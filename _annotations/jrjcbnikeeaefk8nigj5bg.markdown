h_exact: 'Magid’s work can seem like a series of extended pranks, but when I suggested
  this to her she was aghast. “No!” she exclaimed. She laughed but seemed genuinely
  distressed. “I hate mean-spirited work,” she said. “It’s about the engagement. A
  prank doesn’t engage. A prank is: you throw something in and watch what happens.
  This is a commitment.” Still, people often ask Magid why anyone ever agrees to collaborate
  with her. She has said that she thinks it is “due to some combination of vanity,
  pride, and loneliness.”'
