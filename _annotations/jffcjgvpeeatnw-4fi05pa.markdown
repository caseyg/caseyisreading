h_exact: 'Founded in 2004, the Artist Pension Trust consists of nine pools of artists
  in cities such as New York, London, Los Angeles, Berlin, and Beijing. The trust
  holds fourteen thousand works—one of the largest collections of contemporary art
  in the world—and supports more than two thousand artists. The participants are required
  to deposit twenty works into the trust over a twenty-year period. The profits from
  the works that are sold are divided up among the trust’s members: Artists receive
  40 percent of the proceeds from the sale of their works and the other artists divide

  trust’s operating costs.  It was designed so that all participating artists benefit
