h_exact: The Sixty-Ninth shared quarters with purveyors at the Essex Market until
  1880 when the Seventh Regiment vacated the Tompkins Market Armory at Third Avenue
  and Sixth Street. The cast-iron Tompkins Market (demolished in 1911) was to house
  the 69th for the next twenty-six years. However, in 1886, following the Regiment's
  request to the Armory Board, funds were appropriated and a site selection committee
  appointed to provide the 69th Regiment with new, permanent quarters.
