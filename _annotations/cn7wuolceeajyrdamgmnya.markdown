h_exact: 'Commenting on the role of the critic, Ashton said, “The mission of the contemporary
  critic is often construed as a purgative activity, aimed at ridding commentary of
  ornamental maunderings . . . But in the passionate effort to deal with essences,
  or things in themselves, much modern criticism has deleted a whole realm of experience
  . . . The first effort of the critic should be to see the unique quality inherent
  in a work, the quality that immediately attracts the receiver and moves him. But
  the critic must also remember that other action of a work: its expansiveness. If
  it moves us, it can move us emotionally, morally, psychologically, intellectually,
  historically, depending on a host of subtle considerations. It seems to me that
  twentieth-century art must be considered in a double perspective…. Like a big city,
  twentieth-century art has many quartiers.”'
