h_exact: I asked Zanco if she ever felt bored by what appeared to be painstaking,
  lonely work. “Bored?” she said. “Never. But I was in despair often.” She went on,
  “I’m a self-doubting person by nature. I’m not a genius. I am a working horse. I
  know that. And still, after all these years, I have so little to show. It’s demoralizing
  to be confronted with such criticism and aggressions. Am I doing something wrong?
  I have asked myself that many times.”
h_suffix: " We walked around the room once "
