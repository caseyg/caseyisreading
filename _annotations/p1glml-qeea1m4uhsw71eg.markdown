h_exact: 'You plan to do nothing about them. You may, of course, cast a ballot for
  someone who claims to have some plans, as well as the power to act. But this you
  can do only once every two or four years by giving one hour of your time, hardly
  a satisfying means of expressing the broad range of opinions you hold. Voting, we
  might even say, is the next to last refuge of the politically impotent. The last
  refuge is, of course, giving your opinion to a pollster, who will get a version
  of it through a desiccated question, and then will submerge it in a Niagara of similar
  opinions, and convert them into—what else?—another piece of news. Thus, we have
  here a great loop of impotence: The news elicits from you a variety of opinions
  about which you can do nothing except to offer them as more news, about which you
  can do nothing. Prior to the age of telegraphy, the information-action ratio was
  sufficiently close so that most people had a sense of being able to control some
  of the contingencies in their lives. What people knew about had action-value. In
  the information world created by telegraphy, this sense of potency was lost, precisely
  because the whole world became the context for news. Every-thing became everyone''s
  business. For the first time, we were sent information which answered no question
  we had asked, and which, in any case, did not permit the right of reply.'
