r_page_description: I'm going to argue today that even while we know post-truth politics
  is having a terrible effect on our political culture and our role as citizens, it's
  curiously difficult to combat it because of a set of beliefs about what politics
  is, and about the Internet and the way it enables ordinary people to have a voice.
  And these beliefs intersect with a prevailing anti-intellectual anti-elitism which
  associates knowledge, discernment, and truth with snobbery and power.
