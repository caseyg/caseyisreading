r_page_description: What qualifies as jazz these days? There are traditionalists who
  feel it all took a wrong turn when Miles went fully electric, I’m not one of those,
  though to be honest, there are elements of what might be called traditional jazz—its
  roots as dance music for example—that I miss in much “chamber jazz”... but there’s
  room for all faiths, I would hope.
