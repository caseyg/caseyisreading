r_page_description: 'Lecture/panel. February 24 &amp; 25. Kate Moger presents a public
  gallery talk entitled Mark Leckey: Animism, Technology, and The Long Tail. Leckey’s
  multi-media practice is one that fluctuates between modes of artistic and alchemic
  production. Reflecting upon scholar Matteo Pasquinelli''s articulation that “animism
  is a sort of artificial intelligence made in the absence of electricity,” the talk
  will investigate the relationships between technology, spirituality, and affect
  in Mark Leckey’s work. Moger will focus on key works in the artist’s retrospective,
  revealing the spiritual component of feedback loops and the blurring of the boundaries
  between ritual and habit, self and smart fridge, and artist and wizard.'
