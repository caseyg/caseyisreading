r_page_description: A ‘slacktivist’ is someone who chooses to do all or most of their
  activist work through online mediums such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and so on.
  These people are often disregarded as lesser and lazy activists when compared to
  those who are able to do activism work offline. For example, UrbanDictionary.com
  defines slacktivism as, “The act of participating in obviously pointless activities
  as an expedient alternative to actually expending effort to fix a problem”. The
  example given is people signing online petitions as opposed to getting involved
  in neighborhood watches or other offline activities. The concept of ‘slacktivism’
  and that people who focus their ideas online are ‘slacktivists’ is extremely problematic
  and downplays the importance and reach of online activism.
