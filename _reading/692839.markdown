r_page_description: "“UNDERCOVER Boss” sounds like a parody of reality television
  from the early “Survivor” days, when no one was sure just how far producers would
  take the form. But the very real show, which began in 2009 on Britain’s Channel
  4, is now in over a dozen countries, and the popular American version just aired
  its 100th episode."
