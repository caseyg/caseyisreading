r_page_description: Protests at the University of California, Berkeley, forced the
  cancellation of a speech by the right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos on Wednesday.
  He responded with his own video posted to YouTube later that night, saying that
  the left had become antithetical to free speech. President Trump also weighed in
  with a tweet.
