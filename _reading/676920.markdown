r_page_description: Film. November 21. MoMA presents the US premiere of an “audio
  essay” by Beirut-based Jordanian-British artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan, whose work
  attempts to trace and highlight the relationship between the act of listening and
  politics, human rights, international law and borders, testimony, and truth. Using
  audio documentaries and essays, as well as audiovisual installations, Abu Hamdan
  expresses his fascination with different types of listening at work in today’s legal
  and political forums. In this new audio essay (a term the artist prefers to “lecture-performance”),
  he focuses Saydanaya prison, near Damascus. Working with Forensic Architecture,
  Amnesty International, and the survivors of Saydnaya, Abu Hamdan captures “ear-witness
  accounts,” as detainees reconstruct events and the architecture of the prison they
  experienced through sound. The work raises pivotal questions about the politics
  of the field known as “forensic listening.” The artist will be joined for a conversation
  by Ana Janevski, Associate Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art. Lawrence
  Abu Hamdan is a 2015–17 Vera List Center (http://www.veralistcenter.org/engage/people/1990/lawrence-abu-hamdan/)
  Fellow.
