r_page_description: A new and improved status LED indicator provides a pleasing visual
  appeal. An embodiment of the present invention includes a sleep-mode indicator for
  laptop computers. The LED indicator is energized by pulse-width modulated electrical
  pulses. The effect of these pulses on the indicator varies in intensity and mimics
  a rhythm typical of breathing. It is another aspect of the invention to provide
  an electrical apparatus that generates a sleep-mode indicator blinking pattern based
  on a sinusoidal function using PWM (pulse width modulation) designs.
