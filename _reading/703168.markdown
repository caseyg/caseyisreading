r_page_description: In North Dakota, 76 water protectors fighting the $3.8 billion
  Dakota Access pipeline were arrested Wednesday, after militarized police raided
  a new protest camp set up on historic Sioux treaty land. The Last Child Camp was
  established on the west side of Highway 1806 near the main Oceti Sakowin Camp. The
  land is now owned by Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline.
  This is water protector and former North Dakota congressional candidate Chase Iron
  Eyes.
