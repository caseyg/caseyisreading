r_page_description: This class is for artists and creative practitioners who want
  to teach. A good teacher is also a great student themselves. They transform their
  curiosity into knowledge and share their learning process with others. One can learn
  to become a better teacher by staying fearless about ‘not knowing’ something, embracing
  radically open ideas and connecting various expertise and knowledge.
