r_page_description: 'Film. November 21. MoMA presents the US premiere of an “audio
  essay” by Beirut-based Jordanian-British artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan, whose work
  attempts to trace and highlight the relationship between the act of listening and
  politics, human rights, international law and borders, testimony, and truth. Using
  audio documentaries and essays, as well as audiovisual installations, Abu Hamdan
  expresses his fascination with different types of listening at work in today’s legal
  and political forums. MoMA has recently acquired three important works dealing with
  similar themes: The Whole Truth (https://www.moma.org/collection/works/178347),
  Conflicted Phonemes (https://www.moma.org/collection/works/178348), and The Aural
  Contract Audio Archive (https://www.moma.org/collection/works/178346). In this new
  audio essay (a term the artist prefers to “lecture-performance”), he focuses on
  Saydnaya prison, near Damascus. Working with Forensic Architecture, Amnesty International,
  and the survivors of Saydnaya, Abu Hamdan captures “ear-witness accounts,” as detainees
  reconstruct events and the architecture of the prison they experienced through sound.
  The work raises pivotal questions about the politics of the field known as “forensic
  listening.” The artist will be joined for a conversation by Ana Janevski, Associate
  Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art. Lawrence Abu Hamdan is a 2015–17
  Vera List Center (http://www.veralistcenter.org/engage/people/1990/lawrence-abu-hamdan/)
  Fellow.'
