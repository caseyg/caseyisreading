r_page_description: 'Critiques - the presentation and review of student work in front
  of a teacher or critic and peers - have long been a common and powerful learning
  tool in the arts. Apart from allowing a deep engagement with the produced work,
  they also serve as a unique assessment device. Critiques provide a rich learning
  experience but can also be jarring. With art schools redefining their roles in the
  larger context of academia, are critiques still necessary? How have the recent changes
  to the learning landscape—student-centered teaching models, collaborative ways of
  making and online classrooms—changed the nature and practice of critiques?Art School.
  Critique 2.0 will be a multi-faceted exchange of ideas with short presentations,
  panels, and workshops; it will explore multiple aspects of critique: its affordances
  and shortcomings; the artist as critic; and the role of critique in the curriculum.
  The symposium will be the third in a series of recent symposia on teaching and learning
  of studio art in the 21st century. Acknowledging the need for professional development
  of artist- teachers, we will emphasize conversations rather than lectures, following
  an understanding of pedagogy as a practical concern rather than an institutional
  concept.'
