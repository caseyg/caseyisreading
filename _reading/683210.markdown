r_page_description: On June 19th, the Chronicle of Higher Education  ran a web version
  of a mock college syllabus that sought to explore the deep historical and political
  roots of Donald Trump’s political success during the 2016 Presidential campaign.
  The syllabus suffered from a number of egregious omissions and inaccuracies, including
  its failures to include contributions of scholars of color and address the critical
  subjects of racism, sexism, and xenophobia on which Trump has built his candidacy.
  Here, historians N. D. B. Connolly and Keisha N. Blain offer an alternative syllabus in
  response.
