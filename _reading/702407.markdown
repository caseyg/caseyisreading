r_page_description: Today, we’re beginning our rollout of Facebook Ad Campaigns to
  help our customers reach new customers and engage with current ones. Whether your
  goal is to grow your audience or sell more stuff (or both), you can now do it in
  the same place you do all of your email marketing. And with MailChimp’s reporting,
  you can find out which ads generate the most new customers and revenue.
