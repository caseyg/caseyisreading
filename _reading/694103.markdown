r_page_description: Onstage, singer Susannah McCorkle exuded a sultry self-confidence
  that won her lifelong fans. But   in private, she fought depression so deep -- and
  so well hidden -- that a year after her suicide, even some in her most intimate
  circle wonder how they missed the cries for help.
