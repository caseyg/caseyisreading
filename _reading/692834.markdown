r_page_description: Forget about bagging poultry parts or pumping and dumping penny
  stocks. The dirtiest job in America right now is producing reality TV. It consists
  of feeding the public's appetite—which has grown insatiable, after years of expert
  stimulation—with the mixture of sadism and sentimentality, cruel unfairness and
  poetic justice, ugly situations and happy endings, that most of us know by now are
  sheer delusions but that we are as helpless to resist as the next market bubble.
