r_page_description: Keep Calm and Carry On is a catchphrase that originally appeared
  on a World War II-era British public safety poster. After one of the original posters
  was recovered and placed in a British bookshop in 2000, the inspirational message
  was shared online, sparking a series of image macros centered around the phrasal
  template “Keep Calm and X.”
