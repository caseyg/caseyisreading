r_page_description: Every time the worldâ€™s on fire, there are renewed calls for art
  to prove its usefulness. Here, curator Toke Lykkeberg argues that too much gets
  lost if everything turns on the heat of the moment, arguing for an art that is not
  so much contemporary as out of its time. The next Spike, out in March, will pick
  up on some of these ideas with a special issue looking at what art can do, as art,
  beyond merely reacting to our troubled political, social and economic situation.
