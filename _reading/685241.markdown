r_page_description: In honor of America's biggest food holiday, we offer you a bonus
  Thanksgiving episode of our show. First we hop into a canoe with The Kitchen Sisters
  to learn an Ojibwe tribe's traditional method of harvesting wild rice by hand. Then
  Sean Sherman discusses his efforts to bring back Native American cuisine, and Chef
  BJ Dennis gives us a primer on Gullah-Geechie cuisine. We close out the show on
  the Sherry Trail with food writer Kay Plunkett-Hogge.
