r_page_description: 'There are of course many dedicated MMA news sites, and ESPN has
  ramped up coverage, but the best discourse takes place elsewhere. Half of what I’ve
  learned has been from podcasts like Heavy Hands and Fights Gone By and pseudonymous
  YouTube analysts and a Twitter user handled @GrabakaHitman, who’s devoted his life
  to GIFing every last fight anywhere anytime. Exemplary tweet: “Can someone find
  a Fuji TV One stream so I can watch a Russian hand-2-hand combat expert fight a
  Mongolian wrestler on a moat at 4am? Thanks.”'
