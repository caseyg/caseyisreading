r_page_description: Institutional critique has a complex legacy in contemporary art—long
  canonized, the self-reflexive and participatory strategies of artists like Hans
  Haacke and Andrea Fraser have been thoroughly assimilated into the operations of
  many present-day museums. The emergence in the 1990s of movements such as relational
  aesthetics and New Institutionalism, which sought to replace the conventional top-down
  structure of art organizations with one that freely mingles curatorial, artistic,
  and social practices, has led to an increased ambiguity in the relationship between
  museums and their various publics today.
