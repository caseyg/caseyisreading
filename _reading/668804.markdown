r_page_description: "A film created by Carl Schlesinger and David Loeb Weiss documenting
  the last day of hot metal typesetting at The New York Times. This film shows the
  entire newspaper production process from hot-metal typesetting to creating stereo
  moulds to high-speed press operation. At the end of the film, the new typesetting
  and photographic production process is shown in contrast to the old ways.\r"
