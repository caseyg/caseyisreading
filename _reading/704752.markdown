r_page_description: Medium CEO Ev Williams announced today at Upfront Summit that
  his company will launch a consumer subscription product, with the first version
  coming this quarter. This could help develop an additional revenue stream apart
  from advertisements. Finding a strong revenue source is critical, since Medium decided to
  lay off 50 staff, close its New York office, and announce a new direction last month.
