r_page_description: The zany, the cute, and the interesting saturate postmodern culture,
  dominating the look of its art and commodities as well as our ways of speaking about
  the ambivalent feelings these objects often inspire. In this radiant study, Ngai
  offers an aesthetic theory for the hypercommodified, mass-mediated, performance-driven
  world of late capitalism.
