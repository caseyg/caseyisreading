r_page_description: A sense of life’s tragic dimensions has sometimes produced art
  criticism that does more than merely conclude in futile, Sisyphean fashion with
  some supposedly unchanging “condition humaine.”  After all, tragedy in art is not
  always about hopelessness, nor is it necessarily even humorless.
