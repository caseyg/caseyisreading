r_page_description: 'All along the Boardwalk, the sun-bleached, tattered banners read
  do ac — the city’s latest marketing catchphrase. The Boardwalk was a scrum of such
  imperatives, with Trumps on every side issuing edicts and diktats, offering bargains.
  Trumps in toupees and with their guts hanging over their change belts, out on Steel
  Pier, out on Central Pier, trying to get me to try the ring toss, though the rubber
  rings always bounce off the rubber bottles, or to try the beanbag pitch, though
  the lily pads they’re supposed to land on are kept wet and slippery with a shammy.
  Try Fralinger’s Salt Water Taffy, which contains no saltwater. Step right up and
  I’ll guess your weight, or at least I’ll make your wallet lighter. What American
  literature taught me — what Melville taught me in The Confidence-Man, what Poe taught
  me in “Diddling,” that imagination or fantasy can be a form a greed, even a uniquely
  American form — the shills and carny barkers taught me first, at $2 a lesson: I
  would never win that stuffed elephant.'
