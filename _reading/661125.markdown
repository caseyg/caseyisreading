r_page_description: New York magazine was born in 1968 after a run as an insert of
  the New York Herald Tribune and quickly made a place for itself as the trusted resource
  for readers across the country. With award-winning writing and photography covering
  everything from politics and food to theater and fashion, the magazine's consistent
  mission has been to reflect back to its audience the energy and excitement of the
  city itself, while celebrating New York as both a place and an idea.
