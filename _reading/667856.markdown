r_page_description: Triple Canopy is a magazine based in New York. Since 2007, Triple
  Canopy has advanced a model for publication that encompasses digital works of art
  and literature, public conversations, exhibitions, and books. This model hinges
  on the development of publishing systems that incorporate networked forms of production
  and circulation. Working closely with artists, writers, technologists, and designers,
  Triple Canopy produces projects that demand considered reading and viewing. Triple
  Canopy resists the atomization of culture and, through sustained inquiry and creative
  research, strives to enrich the public sphere. Triple Canopy is a nonprofit 501(c)3
