r_page_description: The last of the great, original content sites shuts its doors
  on Monday--just the latest in a string of content companies to close down.  Apparently
  Pseudo couldn't stay afloat even after a $14 million round of funding in May and
  a recent restructuring. Can any content company build a large audience without going
  out of business first?
