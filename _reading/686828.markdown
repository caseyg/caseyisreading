r_page_description: At the northeastern tip of Staten Island lies the town of St.
  George, the docking point of the famous Staten Island Ferry. Within its borders
  is Fort Hill, a fortified British lookout point used during the Revolutionary War.
  By the 1830s, this area of Staten Island facing the Kill van Kull and New York Harbor
  was a fashionable resort town where a wealthy clientele frequented the many elegant
  hotels that graced the areaas hilly terrain. Great estates dotted the landscape
  to take advantage of the unparalleled views of New York City and the bustling harbor
  below. Today St. George is the civic center of Staten Island, as well as a commuting
  hub for islanders who work in the great metropolis across the bay.
