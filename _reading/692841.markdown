r_page_description: '"For a popular television series, Undercover Boss has an unusual
  knack for raising deep and weighty questions."   —Forbes      On February 7, 2010
  the CBS television series Undercover Boss USA premiered to a staggering 38.6 million
  viewers, the largest post-Super Bowl audience for a new series and the most-watched
  premiere episode of any reality series in the history of television.      Now, for
  the first time, the bosses and employees featured on Undercover Boss share the lessons
  they learned as well as the formative experiences that resulted from being on the
  show. Show creators and executive producers Stephen Lambert and Eli Holzman reveal
  how they came up with the idea for the show, how they got a major network on board,
  and of course, how they found a dynamic, charismatic group of bosses willing to
  go undercover—on camera—in this thoroughly new experiment.      Featuring all-new
  interviews and insights with the bosses and employees of the nine businesses featured
  on Season 1 of the show, as well producers'' notes on what you didn''t see behind
  the scenes, this book is a must-have for fans of the show everywhere.   Q&amp;A
  with Undercover Boss Creators and Executive Producers Stephen Lambert and Eli Holzman  How
  did you come up with the idea for the show?  Stephen Lambert had the idea for this
  show in 2008, when he was reading press about the opening of the new British Airways
  terminal, and there were all sorts of problems. One journalist mused that if Willie
  Walsh, the British Airways boss, had himself worked anonymously on the front lines,
  doing luggage sorting and basic functions, he would have anticipated some of these
  problems and headed them off. But the reporter quickly acknowledged that it would
  never work--that Walsh would be too easily recognized by employees. Stephen wondered
  if that were true. Would anyone really recognize the boss, out of context and working
  in the trenches? We suspected they wouldn’t. Fortunately, Britain’s Channel 4 agreed,
  and ordered a pilot that would let us test our theory.   What should fans expect
  from the book?  The book tries to capture the experience that each of the bosses
  had on their undercover journeys in a bit more detail, and with the benefit of 20/20
  hindsight and the ability to reflect on what they were experiencing. It also follows-up
  many of the stories of impressive employees from the episodes to see how that are
  now faring.   Are there any extras?  We also reveal how we chose each boss featured
  on the show and additional behind-the-scenes moments that you didn''t see --some
  funny, some touching. We show you how the show comes together, and also bring you
  up to date on what has happened with the bosses and employees since the show aired.   What
  is your favorite behind-the-scenes moment?  In Covington, Kentucky, we had White
  Castle owner Dave Rife stay in a “budget” motel to enhance the experience of posing
  as an entry-level employee at their frozen products factory. Dave was a remarkably
  good sport, despite such red flags as a sign by the entryway that read no refunds
  after 10 minutes. Despite the lack of linens in the room and the decidedly unhealthy
  odors, Dave remained in high spirits, even cracking a few jokes about the bugs climbing
  the walls--which he referred to as his “new roommates.” But insect infestation was
  the least of our worries that night. The high volume of people going in and out
  of Dave’s room that night, including our small camera crew, attracted the attention
  of the local authorities. Just after we realized that the Covington Police were
  monitoring our comings and goings, we were surrounded by squad cars--headlights
  blazing--and officers asking us a barrage of questions. To make matters worse, we
  had to maintain the confidentiality of the show, so we couldn’t even tell them what
  the cameras were for. Dave’s official White Castle ID eventually put them at ease--but
  Undercover Boss came disturbingly close to becoming America’s Most Wanted.   What
  kind of feedback have you gotten from executives who have appeared on the show?  Employee
  engagement means the difference between someone who cares, who''s focused on work,
  taking a little more pride in it--and someone who is just punching the clock and
  going through the motions. Engagement apparently went way up at Waste Management
  after their episode, in ways they could measure. COO Larry O''Donnell had tried
  so many things, all with an eye to making the workforce engage more--they have company
  newsletters and corporate videos, off-site retreats. But just the one episode that
  was aired touched their workers so much more. For some companies, maybe there''s
  a publicity benefit. But there was just as much publicity risk. '
