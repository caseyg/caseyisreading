r_page_description: 'As conflicts from Iraq to Syria have forced a record 60 million
  people around the world to flee their homes and become refugees, we speak with Scott
  Anderson about his in-depth new report, "Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came
  Apart." Occupying the entire print edition of this weekâ€™s New York Times Magazine,
  it examines what has happened in the region in the past 13 years since the the U.S.
  invaded Iraq through the eyes of six characters in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Iraq and
  Iraqi Kurdistan. Anderson is also author of the book, "Lawrence in Arabia: War,
  Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East."'
